Diabetes Dataset Analysis]

## Project Outcomes
In this project, we analyzed the Diabetes dataset and gained insights into key features related to diabetes. The average BMI and glucose levels were higher in individuals with diabetes compared to those without diabetes. The Random Forest Classifier model was employed to predict diabetes presence, achieving an accuracy rate of 87%.

These findings highlight the importance of BMI and glucose levels as significant factors in diagnosing and understanding diabetes. The results obtained can be utilized for further research, medical interventions, and personalized patient care in diabetes management.

However, it is essential to note that further analysis and exploration can be performed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the dataset and refine the predictive models.
### Duration:
Approximately 3 hours and 20 minutes.
### Project Description:
Introduction:
The aim of this project report is to analyze the Diabetes dataset, which contains 768 rows and 9 columns (features). The dataset focuses on predicting the presence or absence of diabetes in individuals based on various health-related features. The target variable, "Outcome," indicates 1 for persons with diabetes and 0 for non-diabetic patients.

Dataset Overview:

Number of Rows: 768
Number of Columns (Features): 9
Feature Columns: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age
Target Variable: Outcome
Data Quality:

The dataset contains no null values, indicating that it is complete in terms of data availability.
Key Insights:

Average BMI for individuals with diabetes: 35.40
Average BMI for individuals without diabetes: 30.85
Average glucose level for individuals with diabetes: 142.30
Average glucose level for individuals without diabetes: 110.62
Model and Performance:

Model Used: Random Forest Classifier
Accuracy: 87%
